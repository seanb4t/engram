# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-26 — after closing milestone v0.11.x)

**Core value:** Correctable recall precision — a coding agent gets back the RIGHT memory for its context, and wrong/stale memories can be corrected or superseded.
**Current focus:** Planning the next milestone (`/gsd-new-milestone`) — v0.11.x closed 2026-07-26.

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-07-29 — Milestone v0.12.x started

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close on 2026-07-10:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| pending_todo | document-embedding-model-options (docs-site + Helm embedding-model guide) | Picked up in v0.10.x Phase 14 (REQ-embed-model-docs, #337) |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision record lives in `.planning/PROJECT.md` (56 ADR-locked baseline decisions plus the
per-milestone Key Decisions table). Per-milestone detail is archived alongside each milestone in
`.planning/milestones/v*-{ROADMAP,REQUIREMENTS}.md`. This section carries only what the *next*
milestone needs in working memory.

**Standing invariants (do not relitigate without an ADR):**

- Authorization is enforced in `internal/store` (Qdrant read filters + owner gates), never in
  handlers. As of v0.11.x the predicate comes from the `internal/authz` Cedar PDP — bucket-level
  decisions only, compiled into the Qdrant filter; no per-record Cedar eval on bulk paths
  (ADR `engram-cdr1`, refines LOCKED `DEC-cgb`).

- Capture is explicit and zero-junk. No auto-extraction, no similarity-triggered supersession, no
  auto-populated citations.

- Unauthorized id-addressed operations are 404-indistinguishable from a missing id (`DEC-xa6`).
- One Qdrant collection for every memory kind; new features add payload keys, never collections
  (`DEC-2bv`).

**Carry-forward gotchas for the next milestone:**

- New payload keys must survive every sibling write path. Whole-payload `Upsert` either round-trips
  all out-of-band keys (`idempotency_fingerprint`, `superseded_by`, `citations`) or takes
  `store.TargetLocker`; targeted `SetPayload` is the merge-safe alternative.

- `contentFingerprint` (`internal/server/idempotency.go`) hashes an **explicit** field list, not
  reflection — any new client-authored `storeArgs` field must be added to it in the same change, or
  a keyed replay silently discards the caller's value.

- Provider-endpoint URLs must go through the shape-aware `internal/openaiurl.Join`, never a bare
  concat. Fixing one lane and not its sibling is how the doubled-`/v1` bug survived from Phase 13
  to Phase 26.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Open:**

- **Env restore (non-blocking):** repo-local `commit.gpgsign=false` is still set — the 1Password SSH signing agent failed on every commit through v0.11.x, so each used a per-commit `git -c commit.gpgsign=false` override and persistent config was never modified. Restore when 1Password is stable: `git config --local --unset commit.gpgsign`.
- **Deployed server lags `main`:** the running engram instance predates the v0.11.x merges, so `supersede_memory`, memory `citations`, and the `categories` filter are not callable until the next release.
- **Not deployed → not exercised:** every v0.11.x feature is verified against tests and a real Qdrant via testcontainers, but none has run in the deployed instance. Watch the first release for integration surprises.
- **Validation commands can false-green:** `go test -run X ./pkg/...` matching nothing exits 0 with `ok … [no tests to run]`. Phase 26's VALIDATION.md carried two such stale paths (found 2026-07-26). Whenever a package moves, re-point every command that names it — and prove execution with `-v` RUN/PASS pairs, not a package-level `ok`.
- Tracked tech debt: #369 (Renovate self-heal live observation, post-merge only), #366 (console e2e harness), #370 (Taskfile yamlfmt/CI reconciliation), plus 2 high Dependabot alerts open on `main`.
- **CI gates outside the phase lifecycle:** `task chart:validate` (containerEnv checksum pin) and `task ui:build` (vendored SPA) are required checks that no phase gate runs. Run both locally before shipping any phase touching `charts/` or generated TS.

**Resolved during v0.11.x** (kept briefly for traceability, drop at next milestone close):

- ✓ #1 risk — a service principal resolving to `owner==""` is rejected at the verifier boundary; proven by `TestFailClosedRejectsEmptyOwner` as Phase 23's first test.
- ✓ `shared`-across-tenants product question — decided explicitly: stays global for v0.11.x, written and tested (ADR `engram-svct`); per-tenant scoping deferred to full ABAC.
- ✓ Idempotency same-key/different-content contract — locked as **reject, never upsert** (`store.ErrIdempotencyConflict` → Connect `AlreadyExists`), checked before the embedder call.
