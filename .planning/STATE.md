# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10 after v0.9.x milestone)

**Core value:** Correctable recall precision — a coding agent gets back the RIGHT memory for its context, and wrong/stale memories can be corrected or superseded.
**Current focus:** v0.10.x — Hardening & Write Lane (opened 2026-07-10): roadmap created — 9 phases (13–21), 20/20 requirements mapped. Embedder reliability & options (13–14), Connect write lane + CSRF + session rotation (15–19), correctness/CI backlog (20–21).

## Current Position

Phase: Phase 13 (Embedder Reliability Foundation) — not yet started
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap complete; ready for `/gsd-plan-phase 13`
Last activity: 2026-07-10 — Roadmap created for v0.10.x (Phases 13–21)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision record (56 ADR-locked baseline decisions + v0.9.x milestone decisions) in
PROJECT.md. v0.9.x headline decisions: D-04 always-on `search_memory` score; D-06 stdlib
lexical reranker (`store.SearchReranked`); D-01/D-08 async summaries off the write path
drained after shutdown under the CR-01 kernel; D-08 usage signals never affect ranking;
D-09 `ENGRAM_USAGE_SIGNALS` defaults on (non-egressing). Reusable Go conventions: CR-01
shutdown-safety (RWMutex+closed guard); `*time.Time` for optional timestamps (never
`time.Time`+`omitempty`).

**v0.10.x milestone decisions (resolved at scoping, 2026-07-10 — full text in REQUIREMENTS.md):**

- DECISION 1 — Write-lane CRUD scope: full CRUD + Schedule (all six write RPCs ship this milestone).
- DECISION 2 — Session rotation: stateless sliding-expiry re-seal, no server-side state (honors DEC-u9v); a new ADR is required in Phase 18 documenting the no-revocation trade-off.
- DECISION 3 — Reindex boundary: document AND payload-stamp embedder-config identity (Phase 13).

**Roadmap build-order rationale (research-derived, locked at roadmap creation):** embedder track
(13–14) is fully isolated and ships independently. Write-lane track (15–19) is strict-order:
proto+stubs (15) → CSRF interceptor (16) → deps.* refactor + wired handlers (17) → session
rotation (18) → console UX (19). Correctness/polish (20) and CI hygiene (21) are independent of
both tracks. Phases 16–18 are flagged for `/gsd-secure-phase` (18 mandatory — changes the
cookie-auth security posture).

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Env restore (non-blocking):** repo-local `commit.gpgsign=false` is still set (1Password SSH-signing was flaky during the v0.9.x milestone; those commits were unsigned and `main` had no required-signatures). Restore when 1Password is stable: `git config --local --unset commit.gpgsign`. Also sync local `main` past the squash merge (`658795e9`).
- **Research Pitfall 1 (highest risk this milestone):** a Connect write RPC that bypasses `deps.*` and calls `store.*` directly would silently reintroduce the handler-vs-store authz split DEC-cgb rejected, one layer up (business logic, e.g. rule immutability DEC-iedk). Phase 17's success criteria make MCP/Connect parity tests a hard gate, not optional.
- **Research Pitfall 7 (session rotation):** stateless rotation has no revocation mechanism; Phase 18 requires a new ADR explicitly documenting this trade-off before implementation, not a silent drift past DEC-u9v.
- Tracked tech debt now scoped into v0.10.x phases: #334→Phase 14, #335→Phase 21, #333/#332/#331→Phase 13/14, #337→Phase 14. Systemic `.rumdl.toml` `.planning` exclude → Phase 21.
