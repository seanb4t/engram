# Roadmap: engram

## Overview

This is a **retrospective / as-built roadmap** for v0.8.x/v0.9.x, extended by GSD-tracked
milestones going forward. Phases 1–7 group the already-completed v0.8.x work by synthesis area —
Authorization & Isolation, Recall Semantics, Memory Kinds & Tools, Embedder, Config & Transport,
Telemetry & Observability, and Web UI / Docs Site / Distribution. All 56 ADR-locked decisions (25
core + 31 companion refinements, folded 2026-07-08) and all 24 routed v0.8.x requirements are
implemented and merged to main. Per-phase implementation plans are cross-referenced in
`.planning/intel/merge-plans/context.md`. Phase 8 (Connect observe-lane auth hardening, R1–R4) was
**found already shipped** during a 2026-07-08 reconciliation — the cookie/OIDC lane landed
opportunistically inside PR #248 and was hardened in PR #266, before this retrospective baseline
was authored; the earlier "deferred stub" framing (ingested from the 2026-06-09 plan/spec, which
described the interim anonymous state as current) was stale. Phases 9–12 (v0.9.x — Recall
Quality) shipped 2026-07-10 (PR #336); full detail archived at `milestones/v0.9.x-ROADMAP.md`.
Phases 13–21 (v0.10.x — Hardening & Write Lane) shipped 2026-07-16; full detail archived at
`milestones/v0.10.x-ROADMAP.md`. Success criteria are stated as observable truths that hold when
each phase completes.

Phases 22–26 (v0.11.x — Capture & Service Identity) shipped 2026-07-26; full detail archived at
`milestones/v0.11.x-ROADMAP.md`. The research-derived build order held end to end: the Cedar authz
foundation landed first as the trust anchor (a behavior-preserving refactor of `internal/store`'s
filter/gate functions, refining LOCKED `DEC-cgb` via new ADR `engram-cdr1` rather than overriding
it), then service-auth-chain + tenancy isolation — where the milestone's #1 risk, a service
principal silently resolving to `owner==""`, was proven fail-closed as the phase's first test —
then the capture trio in strict internal order (idempotency → supersession → citations, since
supersession reuses idempotency's re-Upsert mechanism), with the category filter and the
chat/summarize base-URL split as a low-risk independent tail. The milestone held its two standing
constraints: zero new store-layer authz **primitive**, and (except `cedar-go`) zero new
dependencies — every feature extended an existing seam.

**v0.12.x — Headless Reach & Diagnosability (Phases 1–7), opened 2026-07-29, shipped 2026-08-02.**
Two halves: make engram reachable by agents that are **not** a top-level MCP client, and make what
the server decides and rejects legible. The structural root is a bearer-token identity on the
ConnectRPC lane — today that lane has exactly one credential type (a sealed cookie session) and one
reason to be mounted (the UI is enabled), so a headless deployment has no Connect surface at all.
Research (HIGH confidence, 4-dimension fan-out at `.planning/research/`) confirmed **zero new Go
dependencies** are required and found two security-critical, silently-passing defect classes
concentrated in that first phase: a CSRF exemption keyed on request-controlled input would be a full
bypass on all six write RPCs, and Connect never routes through `mcpauth.RequireBearerToken`, whose
private `verify()` is the only place `TokenInfo.Expiration` is enforced — so reusing
`auth.ChainVerifier` alone makes token expiry decorative on that lane. Both compile, vet, lint, and
pass a happy-path suite. Per the v0.11.x precedent, the fail-closed negative tests are v0.12.x Phase 1's
first tests, not follow-up work. Research also raised and deliberately **did not resolve** a
disagreement about `cross_spine` (v0.12.x Phase 3): whether the store-layer authz `Must` clause composes
independently of the scope clause is to be settled by reading `Store.Search` end to end, not by
analogy to `search_discovery`.

**v0.13.x — Curation & Self-Evidence (Phases 1–5 plus inserted 03.1), opened 2026-08-03, shipped
2026-08-12.** Closed
two classes v0.12.x left to human diligence. First: an `engram spine-review` CLI resolving
**structural** spine predicates (drifted `file:line` citations, near-duplicate candidates,
purge-eligible records, an archive tier) through the existing Subject-less operator tier
(`reindex`/`migrate-remap-owner`/`prune-expired`/`summarize-missing`/`backfill-short-ids`) — never
a new authorization path — paired with a companion curation skill for the **semantic** judgments a
CLI cannot make ("is this still true," "are these the same fact"), propose-never-perform, reusing
`store_rule`'s consent gate verbatim. Second: a correct-by-reading interface audit that states
every server-side conditional requirement on both the cobra `Usage` text and the MCP jsonschema
tags with a CI conformance gate, adds MCP tool blast-radius annotations
(`readOnlyHint`/`destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint`), pins `--help` output, and unifies the CLI's
flag-exclusivity enforcement (#453) with its exit-code taxonomy (#467) **in the same phase** —
because cobra's `MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive` raises a plain `fmt.Errorf` that bypasses
`cliError`/`ExitCode()`, adopting #453 without resolving #467 first would reintroduce, one command
over, the exact undocumented exit-code split #467 exists to close. The exit-code change ships as a
unification (not a documented boundary), with a pinned-current-behavior regression test authored
before the change, a consumer audit, and a `guides/upgrade.md` entry. Also folds in the still-open
Nyquist `VALIDATION.md` reconciliation debt inherited from v0.12.x (six `status: draft` rows plus
one phase with none). Research (HIGH confidence) confirmed **zero new Go dependencies**: citation
drift detection is a byte compare against `Citation.Excerpt` already cached at write time,
near-duplicate scoring reuses a stored vector via `qdrant.NewQueryID` (no re-embedding), and the
flag/timeout gaps are one-line `cobra`/stdlib fixes.

<summary>✅ v0.11.x — Capture & Service Identity (Phases 22–26) — SHIPPED 2026-07-26</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Make programmatic capture correct and re-runnable, and give headless service
principals a first-class, isolated identity — so agents can write memory mechanically and safely
into shared stores.

Requirements outcomes at [`milestones/v0.11.x-REQUIREMENTS.md`](milestones/v0.11.x-REQUIREMENTS.md).

<summary>✅ v0.13.x — Curation & Self-Evidence (Phases 1–5 plus inserted 03.1) — SHIPPED 2026-08-12</summary>

Full detail archived at [`milestones/v0.13.x-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.13.x-ROADMAP.md). The
`### Phase N:` detail sections were moved out of this file at milestone close so a bare heading
resolves to the **active** milestone, not this shipped one — the same reason the v0.8.x block
records.

- [x] **Phase 1: Interface Enforceability** - Flag-group validation and one exit-code taxonomy resolved together (#453/#467), plus an operator-configurable CLI request timeout (#452) (completed 2026-08-04)
- [x] **Phase 2: Interface Discoverability** - Conditional rules stated on both the cobra and MCP surfaces with a CI conformance gate, MCP tool blast-radius hints, pinned `--help` golden files (completed 2026-08-05)
- [x] **Phase 3: Spine Curation — Structural (CLI)** - `engram spine-review scan/verify/consolidate/purge/archive` through the existing Subject-less operator tier (completed 2026-08-07)
- [x] **Phase 03.1: Merge Supersession (INSERTED)** - `supersede_memory` accepts multiple `supersedes` targets, so a duplicate set collapses to one survivor with history preserved for every predecessor and no `delete_memory` in the merge path (completed 2026-08-11)
- [x] **Phase 4: Spine Curation — Semantic (Skill)** - A companion skill judges staleness and near-duplicate identity, proposing only, never mutating without consent (completed 2026-08-11)
- [x] **Phase 5: Validation Debt Reconciliation** - This milestone's own phases re-resolved against `go test -list` with each record stating what it found, and #355's drifted citations repaired as the plain docs fix they are (completed 2026-08-12)

## Progress

**Execution Order:** 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 (v0.8.x, shipped) · 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 (v0.9.x, shipped 2026-07-10) · 13 → 14 (embedder track) · 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 (write-lane track, strict order) · 20 → 21 (independent) — v0.10.x shipped 2026-07-16 · 22 → 23 (Cedar foundation → service auth/tenancy, strict order) · 24 → 25 → 26 (capture trio + recall/config tail, strict order; 24 can start in parallel with 22–23) — v0.11.x shipped 2026-07-26 · v0.12.x: 1 → 2 (spine → CLI, strict order) · 3 · 4 · 5 · 6 (independent of the spine and of each other; ran in parallel once 1 was underway) · 7 (CLI cross-spine wiring, closed the audit seam between 2 and 3) — v0.12.x shipped 2026-08-02 · v0.13.x: 1 · 2 (parallelizable with each other) → 3 (needs 1 and 2 settled first) → 4 (authored in parallel with 3, full acceptance trails it) → 5 (last; needs 3's `verify` for the #355 fixture, reconciles each phase's own validation as it closes) — v0.13.x planned 2026-08-03
